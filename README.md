# RenArt Case Study â€“ Product Listing Application

This project is a full-fledged product listing application that I developed as part of the RenArt case study.
The backend was written in Node.js (Express), while the frontend was developed in React.
Products are dynamically priced based on the real-time gold price, and users can filter by price and popularity.
I made sure to follow the design layout exactly. A carousel, color picker, and responsive structure were also implemented.
